# Becoming a Command Line Commando

## Installing the Openstack Command Line tools

The Openstack Command Line tools are essentially a Python library.  If you are not familiar with Python, it is a modern interpreted language that has a simple syntax and is easy to learn while also being full-featured and extremely powerful.  

So, the first step in installing the Openstack Command Line tools is to first get Python installed.  One important thing to understand about Python is that there are currently two distinct versions of Python; Python 2 and Python 3.  The Openstack Openstack Command Line tools are currently only work with the older Python 2 and so that is what we will install.

Below are some great tutorials if you need help installing Python 2 on Windows, Mac, or Linux:
