# Cisco Cloud Rotation Program
This is repository for the FIRST ever Cisco Cloud , Containers & Microservices Partner Rotation Program. Purpose of this program is to enable and enhance partner Cloud / Application / Containers practice teams so that they are better equiped with the knowledge and toolsets necessary for developing apps using cloud. Program's first alpha run was conducted from May 9-13, 2016

We're not teaching how to INSTALL openstack or containers rather how to USE. Though there are facets of the exercises which are un-avoidable while developing applicaitons , e.g. creating a CI/CD pipeline when you dont have one already or modifying it to suit your environment. 
We're thankful to our partner community specially GDT ( GDT.COM ) who helped develop , provided feedback and incorporated great ideas . 
Truly making this program for the partners from the partners.
